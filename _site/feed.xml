&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;오늘 휴직 전 마지막 출근날이다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“마지막 **” 이런것에 의미를 갖는게 의미가 있을까? 어떤 사건에 대해 기억하고 의미를 부여하는 행위는 그 시점 이후의 새로운 나를 만드는데 필요한 일인것 같기도 하다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;휴직이 마냥 홀가분하도 기쁘고 기대감이 클 줄 알았지만 그렇지 않아서 혼란스럽다. 휴직한다고 하면 사람들이 마냥 부러워하던데 생각보다 그렇지가 않은것 같다. 사실 아직까지도 휴직 후 무엇을 할지 구체적으로 정해진 것들이 없어서 불안하고 두렵다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;마지막 출근날인데도 처리되지 않은것들이 상당히 남아있어 걱정된다. 원체 계획성도 없고 그때그때 일처리를 하지 못하는 성격이라 지금까지 미뤄졌다. 내가 어느정도 고쳐야할 습관인데 고치기 싫다. &lt;strong&gt;근면 성실&lt;/strong&gt;.. 이 사회가 우리 노동자들에게 강요하는 이념 같아서 거부감이 느껴진다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;마지막 출근날인데도 야근을 해야 한다. 이번주 근무시간도 모두 채우지 못했다. 그동안 육신에 문제가 생겼다. 업무 중간에 병원도 다녀와야 한다. 회사다닐때 병원에 다녔으면 의료비 지원을 받았을텐데 어리석게도 뒤늦게 병원에 다니게 되어 의료비 지원은 물건너 갔다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;어제부로 회사에 입사한지 4년이 되는 날이었다. 곧 3월이 되면 진급을 한다. 몇일만 기다렸다가 3월에 진급을 한 뒤에 휴직하면 연봉을 올려놓고 휴직 할 수 있었는데 그렇게 하지 않았다. 어리석은 선택이다. 돈 따위는 내 삶에 중요하지 않다는 선언을 스스로에게 하고 싶었다. 그러나 남들이 보기엔 여전히 어리석은 선택일 뿐이다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;퇴직도 아니고 고작 휴직 하는것인데도 많은 고민과 용기가 필요했다. 잘 할 수 있을까? 기대보다 걱정이 앞서는 앞으로의 1년이다. 아주 이상한 기분이다.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="포스팅" /><summary type="html">오늘 휴직 전 마지막 출근날이다.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2014/09/24/man-must-explore/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest" /><published>2014-09-24T21:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2014-09-24T21:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2014/09/24/man-must-explore</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2014/09/24/man-must-explore/">&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
